Replication of Smets and Wouters (AER, 2007)

Solves and estimates the model with Dynare (http://www.dynare.org), and makes some tables from the paper.

Table 1A--Prior and Posterior Distribution of Structural Parameters
Table 1B--Prior and Posterior Distribution of Shock Processes

This is essentially a rewrite of Smets and Wouters' own code, which is available at
